Please email engineering@skiplinow.com if you have any questions and provide as much details as possible.

Note: we don‚Äôt condone cheating of any kind. You are welcome to look things up on Google but you can‚Äôt have anyone else do this coding challenge for you. Our system detects if you copy and paste code. It also runs your code against our database of solutions to check for similarities. 

Front-end
Project: Real-Time Board Management Tool ( Mini Trello App )

Overview:

Develop a real-time card management tool that allows teams to collaborate on cards, track tasks, and monitor progress in real-time. The application should support multiple users, card creation, task assignment, drag-and-drop task management feature and dynamic updates across all connected users.

Idea: Create a responsive web application using React.js with real-time updates using WebSocket technology.

Card Setup:
Initialize a new React.js card using Create React App or another preferred method. (You are also welcome to set up the app using Next.js or Vite instead of Create-React-App.)
Set up card dependencies, including libraries for routing, state management, and real-time updates (e.g., WebSocket library).
Authentication:
Connect authentication components to backend API endpoints (/auth/signup, /auth/signin).

Dashboard Design:
Design a dashboard layout using a responsive grid system (e.g., CSS Grid, Bootstrap grid).
Create navigation components for accessing different sections of the application (e.g., cards, profile).
Implement dynamic rendering of user-specific content based on authentication status.

card Management:
Design and implement a card listing interface displaying all cards associated with the authenticated user.
Add options for creating new cards and displaying card details.
Integrate CRUD functionality for cards (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) with backend API endpoints (/cards, /cards/:id).

Task Management:
Develop task management components within each card, including task lists and task detail views.
Implement functionality for creating, updating, and deleting tasks.
Integrate real-time updates for task lists using WebSocket technology to reflect changes made by other users.
Add features for task assignment, priority setting, deadline tracking, and status updates.
Use a library like React DnD (Drag and Drop for React) to handle drag-and-drop interactions.
Configure draggable and droppable areas within the card interface.
Enable users to drag tasks from one location to another, such as between task lists or within a card board ( You can create some default status card boards like icebox, backlog, on going, waiting for review, done).


List Users
Create a list users component for viewing and editing to manage account settings.
Connect profile components to backend API endpoints for updating user information (/users/:id).

Styling and UI Enhancements:
Apply consistent styling using CSS frameworks (e.g., Bootstrap, Material UI) or CSS preprocessors (e.g., Sass, Less).
Implement responsive design principles to ensure the application is usable across different devices and screen sizes.
Enhance user experience with animations, transitions, and interactive elements.

Backend:

GitHub Integration:
Enables users to sign in with GitHub OAuth, offering additional authentication options.
Provides API endpoints for initiating GitHub sign-in process and exchanging authorization codes for access tokens.

Sure, let's update the backend API routes for card and task management, as well as authentication:

With this endpoint, when a user clicks on a repository, your system can fetch all relevant information (branches, pull requests, issues, commits) from GitHub and display it accordingly. This provides a comprehensive overview of the repository's activity and status, helping users stay informed about its development.

To implement authentication without using passwords and instead sending a code to the user's email for verification, you can modify the authentication API endpoints as follows:

Authentication API Endpoints:

1. User Signup:
   - Endpoint: `/auth/signup`
   - Method: POST
   - Description: Creates a new user account.
   - Request Body:
     
     {
       "email": "user@example.com",
       ‚ÄúverificationCode‚Äù: ‚Äúcode_compare_to_code_from_email‚Äù
     }
     
   - Response:
     - Success (201 Created):
       {
         "id": "user_id",
         "email": "user@example.com"
       }
       
2. User Sign In (with Email Verification):
   - Endpoint: `/auth/signin`
   - Method: POST
   - Description: Authenticates existing users by sending a verification code to the user's email and comparing it to code in db .
   - Request Body:
     
     {
       "email": "user@example.com",
       "verificationCode": "code_received_via_email"
     }
     
   - Response:
     - Success (200 OK):
       
       {
         "accessToken": "jwt_access_token"
       }
     
     - Error (401 Unauthorized):
   
       {
         "error": "Invalid email or verification code"
       }
       

For the signup process, the user provides their email address, and then you can send a verification code to that email for account creation.

For the signin process, the user provides their email and the verification code received via email which is matched with verification code in DB. Upon successful verification, the user is issued a JWT access token for authentication.

You can use nodemailer in your backend to send emails containing the verification codes. Once the user enters the correct code, you can authenticate them and issue an access token.
